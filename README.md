#### Description
December 14, 1942, Operation Winter Storm. The German Sixth Army is only a few dozen km away from Stalingrad, and the Fourth Army Panzer has changed its attacking direction to help conquer Stalingrad.
After a fierce battle at the edge of the city, which lasted for three days, the last battle will take place near the entrance of Stalingrad between a Panzer IV German tank and a Soviet T-34 tank.

#### Requirements:
     
* to create a mini-game (text format) to emulate the battle of Stalingrand between the two tanks.
* the properties of the tanks will be loaded from a database using web services.
* Sometimes you will encounter various obstacles on the battlefield, so you have to think about different tactics of attack or defense. These obstacles can be loaded into the game using web services.
* Both tanks are controlled by a mini AI, and the emulation of the battle must be done in a game session. You can emulate at least two battles simultaneously, each with its own session.
* The result of the battle must be saved in a score table using web services.

# Repository Details
### Client Side
  * Knows how to render the players in the terminal (using: [terminal-kit](https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit))
  * Knows how to control the tank in the current session (AI)
  * The client doesn't have a game loop, it wait for the server to request inputs for the next frame

Clients wait for the server to request the next frame input, they process the next action they want to take and send it to the server.
After the server validates each clients action, it will send back what action the client should take (either what they sent, or NOOP if the action is not valid, ex: collisions)
  
### Sever Side
* An authoritative lock-stepped multiplayer server 
* Input data, collisions, bullet movement, etc.. are validated on the server
* As a database the server uses SQLite
* The server knows: HTTP and WebSockets

### Tank actions
* Each tank has 3 types of actions that he can take:
  * **rotate** -> no cooldown
  * **move** -> has cooldown (based on the properties the tank chose)
  * **shoot** -> has cooldown (based on the properties the tank chose)
  
### HTTP Request examples (GET only, for easy copy&paste links)
* Adding a tank property
  * ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tank_properties/update?type=chassis&value=50
    ```
* Updating a tank property
  * ```
    (same as above, but also contains the ID of the property that needs to be updated)
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tank_properties/update?type=chassis&value=50&id=WwcaFvhO0LUE-7nO
    ```
* Adding a map (this is a really big request)
  * ```
